# Empatica-E4-Biosignal-Analysis
This repository provides the code for the collected raw biosignals from Empatica-E4 medical graded watch. The data was collected under 3 different experimental conditions of prosthesis uses
Interbeat-interval was used to calculate heart beat variation, from which one can understand the potential flucutation due to either:

1) Increase in prosthesis weight
2) Increase in prosthesis latency, here latency define as the time between the muscle activation and DC control activation.
